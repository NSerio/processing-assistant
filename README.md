# processing-assitant
Relativity Application: This application allows a user to create a processing set by pointing at a directory which contains folders of custodian data.  The resulting processing set will contain one processing data source for each folder in the selected directory and will associate the data source to the custodian based on the folder name.

# Project Setup
This project requires references to kCura's RelativityÂ® SDK dlls.  These dlls are not part of the open source project and must be obtained through kCura.  In the "packages" folder under "Source" you will need to create a "Relativity" folder if one does not exist.  You will need to add the following dlls:

- kCura.Agent.dll
- kCura.EventHandler.dll
- kCura.Relativity.Client.dll
- Relativity.API.dll
- Relativity.CustomPages.dll
